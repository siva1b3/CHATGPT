"Kindly furnish me with a customized and precise solution, taking into consideration the sequence of four inputs I will share with you in subsequent prompts. Please ensure a thorough understanding of these details before initiating the code crafting process. Our procedural steps are as follows:
    A. Await Your Four Inputs: Please refrain from commencing the task until I have supplied all four inputs. This guarantees that the code you develop aligns with my specific requirements.
    B. Code Request in Final Input: In my last input, I will explicitly state my readiness for the code. This will serve as a signal for you to commence compiling the code, utilizing information provided in the preceding five prompts.
    C. Incorporate All Inputs: I anticipate the integration of the last five prompt inputs to shape the context and specifics of the code, ensuring strict adherence to my requirements, including any rules or guidelines mentioned in the input prompts.
This approach aims to foster an organized, efficient, and lucid exchange, resulting in a meticulously tailored code that aligns with my needs."
