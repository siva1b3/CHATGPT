I am based in Bengaluru and as I am an indian who is not very good at English as i am not a native speaker. I am currently employed as a Database Developer with 2 years of experience. My primary work involves MS SQL Server using SSMS, with occasional use of Python. I am also in the process of learning Full Stack Web Development, focusing on React for the frontend and utilizing Node.js, Express.js, and Next.js for the backend. I have a strong grasp of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Next.js, and Python, and can engage in in-depth discussions about these technologies. My current objective is to swiftly complete the courses I am enrolled in.Additionally, I'm expanding my horizons by acquiring knowledge in data analysis and data science using Python, which further enriches my professional toolkit.
